# Project Title: **Semantic Segmentation in Self-driving vehicles with U-Net**

## Objective
This project focuses on performing semantic segmentation for autonomous driving using the U-Net architecture. The goal is to predict segmentation masks that classify different regions of an image, such as roads, vehicles, and pedestrians.

## Workflow

### 1. Dataset Preparation
- The dataset is comprised of **RGB input images** and corresponding **segmentation masks**.
- **Segmentation Masks**: These masks are 2D grayscale images where each pixel represents a specific class (e.g., road, vehicle, pedestrian).
- The dataset is split into **80% for training** and **20% for validation**, ensuring that the model is trained and evaluated on different data.

### 2. Data Transformation
- The 2D segmentation masks are converted into **3D arrays** (one-hot encoded), where each channel corresponds to a class label. This transformation is crucial for enabling the model to predict a class for each pixel in the input image.
- The input images are resized and normalized to fit the input requirements of the U-Net architecture.

### 3. U-Net Model Architecture
- The project uses the **U-Net architecture**, which is widely used for image segmentation tasks.
  - **Encoder (Contracting Path)**: The encoder captures important features from the input image through a series of downsampling steps, reducing the image size while preserving key information.
  - **Decoder (Expanding Path)**: The decoder restores the original image size using upsampling.
  - **Skip Connections**: These are used to connect corresponding layers in the encoder and decoder to retain spatial information, which helps in producing accurate segmentation masks.

### 4. Model Training
- The U-Net model is trained using a supervised learning approach, where the input images are paired with their corresponding segmentation masks. The model learns to map each pixel in an image to its correct class.
- The training process uses batch processing, allowing the model to learn from smaller groups of data and speed up training. The model performance is monitored, and the best-performing version is saved using checkpoints.

### 5. Segmentation Output
- Once trained, the U-Net model produces **segmentation masks** for new input images. Each pixel in the predicted mask corresponds to a specific class, such as road or vehicle.
- Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy** and **Intersection over Union (IoU)**. These metrics help measure the overlap between predicted masks and the ground truth.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install all the necessary dependencies by following the instructions in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. Prepare the dataset and organize it into the required folder structure.
3. Execute the notebook or script to train the model and generate segmentation outputs.

## Notes
- Ensure that the dataset is properly split into training and validation sets before beginning the training process.
- Adjust hyperparameters like batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs to optimize performance based on the available computational resources.
